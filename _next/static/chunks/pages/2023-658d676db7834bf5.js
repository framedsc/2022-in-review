From sequels to updates, new IP’s\n  to remakes, we’ve been spoiled for choice in 2023, so let’s go over what\n  captivated the Framed community throughout the year.\n  "],top10sys:["Coming in strong and surprising no one, Cyberpunk 2077\n  continues to dominate the Share Your Shot channel with a whopping\n  1624 shots shared by the community in 2023, no doubt spurred on\n  by the recent game work and DLC content released this year.\n  Hogwarts legacy managed to conjure its way into the second highest position\n  with 987 shots thanks to its vibrant imagining of the Hogwarts scenery and\n  impressively lush landscapes, followed swiftly by this year’s biggest\n  RPG offering and GOTY winner at this year’s Game Awards.\n  With 575 Baldurs Gate 3 shots earning it third place in the rankings,\n  we can be assured that the internet will never be lacking on portraits\n  of Astarion, Shadowheart, and Lae’zel anytime soon.\n  "],top10hof:["Among the 15000+ shots of 2023, the community reacted and\n  voted for their favorites to earn their esteemed place within the\n  Hall of Framed, Unsurprisingly Cyberpunk once again claims the\n  top spot this year, through sheer volume alone these dystopian vistas and\n  neon-soaked portraits have claimed the title as the game with\n  the highest number of shots entering the HOF this year.\n  And to mirror the same pattern of the Share Your Shot trends,\n  so too has Hogwarts snuck in at second place with its mystical\n  forests spellbinding surroundings.
